# about-scienti-username
I'd like to talk about your username and this was the way I found to try and contact you.

I'm starting a new company. It's a startup from scratch, totally bootstraped and your GitHub username matches the company name. I've seen that your account is idle for several years and I would like to know if you would mind to kindly transfer the name your using so we can start a properly named organization on GitHub.

If you are willing to talk about it, please accept my invitation and let's talk through the platform or any other channel we figure out.
